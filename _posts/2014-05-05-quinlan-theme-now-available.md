After much procrastination, I finally around to putting together my first Jekyll template. The goal is to offer a bare bones, simple, and elegant website design to academics so folks can get up and running with a personal site on GitHub Pages website quickly. It was developed in little over a day or so while in conjunction with a workshop at the University of Michigan on creating and hosting a personal website with GitHub Pages. It is meant to be used as a base template that is extended as needed. Enjoy!
